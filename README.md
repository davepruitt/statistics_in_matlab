# Statistics in Matlab

In 2017, I was working as a post-doc at the Texas Biomedical Device Center at UT Dallas (https://txbdc.utdallas.edu/), and I was asked to give a presentation about how to do statistics in Matlab. Since giving that presentation, several people have asked me to share it with them, so I made the presentation available (and it is still available) via the following link:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jN6QwPDIc-pPG6503SdiGzc_Fh5rCV8vh73_3umkC60/edit?usp=sharing

One unfortunate issue with the original presentation is that all the code examples are pasted into the presentation as images, so you can't copy-and-paste the code examples. I was recently asked to give this statistics presentation again, and so I decided to update the presentation by converting it to markdown format and posting it here on Github. This will enable people to easily copy-and-paste the code examples.

I am _not_ a "statistics guru". While I have taken several statistics courses in my life, and while I have used statistics very often in my career/research, my formal training is in computer science and in neuroscience. So if any professional statisticians come across this and think corrections need to be made, feel free to reach out to me.

Hopefully this can be helpful to anyone who is trying to perform statistics with their research data in Matlab.
